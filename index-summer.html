<h2 id="expectations">Expectations and Structure of This Online Course</h2>
<p>This will be an adventure for all of us but it will be a fun one for sure.  A few notes on the expectations and structure of this course:</p>

<h3>1. What this course will NOT have and what I will NOT do:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have set office hours.</li>
<li>Require students to meet online during specific times.</li>
<li>Require students to work in teams, a semester group project.</li>
<li>Require students to physical meet at the Tufts Medford Campus.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many good reasons why I will not do any of the above items:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's summertime.  Many of you have commitments and plans already scheduled (e.g., vacation, dinners, weddings, conferences, family get-togethers).</li>
<li>A number of you are working (full-time or internship).  That's more important as people need to live, eat.</li>
<li>Some students are taking this course abroad.  Thus, there are time zone differences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding constraints and extra burden to your lives especially during the summer will not fit well with anyone.  Extra constraints and burden also defeat the purpose of an online course.  Thus, you will probably not see me at all this summer.</p>

<h3>2. You are on your own pace.</h3>
<p>You can choose to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pace yourself during the week</li>
<li>Do everything during the weekend</li>
<li>Do everything during the last minute</li>
<li>Don't do any of the work</li>
</ol>
<p>Your choice, but the latter three choices are not wise.</p>

<h3>3. You are responsible for your own learning.</h3>
<p>A very important point: if you want everything gone over in lecture or in notes, then this is not the course for you. More importantly, that's not how things work in real life.</p>

<h3>4. You will learn by doing.</h3>
<p>Each week, there will be at most three labs (and a quiz every other week) to hone your skills and to aim at the crux of the matter for the week.  Here's an analogy: you don't learn how to cook simply by just reading cookbooks and watching YouTube videos.  You learn by making, using your hands, and making mistakes.</p>

<h3>5. You will learn by asking questions.</h3>
<p>It is your responsibility to ask questions early and to ask for help...</p>

<h3>6. ...and I expect this Piazza board to be very active and civil.</h3>
<p>Share thoughts and respond to other people's questions.  The TAs and myself will be online constantly, thus the idea of set office hours almost becomes moot point.  It is no secret that I respond very quickly unless I need to be away.</p>

<h3>7. As for the workload...</h3>
<p>Hard to say because the skill-set of the students varies: from those who have just completed Introduction to Computer Science and/or Data Structures to those who already have a Computer Science degree.  In terms of number of hours you should expect to spend per week, my rough estimate and expectation is anywhere from 3 to 10 hours of work a week.</p>

<p>There is a very good post published by Northeastern University: "How To Be a Successful Online Learner."
