# Lab: The Fuzzer

## Objectives

1. Be exposed to software testing techniques.
2. Learn and implement a fuzzer.

## Overview

Fuzz testing or fuzzing is an automated software testing technique (black box) throwing invalid, malformed, and unexpected data at a computer program. The goal is to make a program crash, violate invariants, to find potential memory leaks, evidence of user input not handled correctly, and other bugs. Think of fuzzing as poking holes at a computer program. A fuzzer is a program that is used for fuzz testing. In this lab, you will write a fuzzer to find at least reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) bugs.

From OWASP: "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) occur when an attacker injects browser executable code within a single HTTP response. The injected attack is not stored within the application itself; it is non-persistent and only impacts users who open a maliciously crafted link or third-party web page. The attack string is included as part of the crafted URI or HTTP parameters, improperly processed by the application, and returned to the victim."

## Basic Requirements

At the very least, your fuzzer must be (1) written in Python and (2) must able to determine that the page at http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/20/hackme.php has a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

This lab is worth a total of 10 points. Completing this basic requirement will give you 7 points.

## Going Beyond

The way I am structuring this lab is to give you freedom and flexibility to do something cool. The more you put into writing your fuzzer, the more you will be rewarded.

* (+1) Use all the fuzzing lists that Daniel Miessler provided in https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Fuzzing. NOTE: your fuzzer must prompt user to enter location of where the SecLists folder is on workstation for portability reasons.
* (+2) Extend the fuzzer to test any page for reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.
* BONUS Opportunities (+1):
  * Extend the fuzzed to test for another web security vulnerability or to fuzz not just web pages and web applications (e.g., a remote application running on some remote port --e.g., SMB that is a target for WannaCry).
  * Something way cool not listed or perhaps I did not think of. Please email me your idea.
What's The Point of This Lab?

Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and many web application security suites come with a fuzzer. Case-in-point: watch "How to Fuzz Websites for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Using Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmbi-VbIK6I). While fuzzers have proven to be valuable, it is important for you to understand how fuzzers work as a good security practitioner. This exercise also provides you more exposure to software testing which isn't emphasized enough (or at all) in a Computer Science curriculum. On a personal note, fuzzing is a topic I still wish I had more exposure to when I started delving into Cyber Security over a decade ago.

## The `README` File

This `README` file shall describe the work. This description must:

* Briefly explain what this tool is (that is, an overview).
* Briefly explain how the tool works.
* Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
* Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
* Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
* Be written in either text format (`README.txt`) or in Markdown (`README.md`). No other formats will be accepted.
Submission

Your submission shall contain at least two files: the README file and one Python .py file.
