    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>Q: Is there a textbook for this course?</h3>
    <p>A: No</p>
    <h3>Q: Are there teaching assistants (TAs) for this course?</h3>
    <p>A: No</p>
    <h3>Q: What is the workload of this course?</h3>
    <p>A: Here is a list of all the labs with expected length and difficulty:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lab 1: Working with the Command Line, Short (1 hour max) to Long (3+ hours) --you can put in as much time as you want on this lab</li>
        <li>Lab 2: Packet Sleuth, Medium (1 - 3 hours)</li>
        <li>Lab 3: Scanning and Reconnaissance, Very short (30 minutes). <strong>NOTE: This lab cannot be made publicly available because an actual target is used.</strong></li>
        <li>Lab 4: Python and the Incident Alarm, Long (over 3 hours) to Impossible</li>
        <li>Lab 5: The Password Cracking Contest, If you crack all the password hashes (read: good luck with that), you will receive an automatic "A" in the course</li>
        <li>Lab 6: The XSS Game, Medium</li>
        <li>Lab 7: Gain Access to Website, Very short. <strong>NOTE: This lab cannot be made publicly available because an actual target is used.</strong></li>
        <li>Lab 8: The CTF Game, One week --team based. <strong>NOTE: This lab cannot be made publicly available because an actual target is used.</strong></li>
        <li>Lab 9: Technical Risk Analysis, Short to Medium.</li>
        <li>Lab 10: Android Malware Analysis, Short to Medium</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Q: Does this course count towards the M.S. in Cybersecurity and Public Policy?</h3>
    <p>A: Yes</p>
    <h3>Q: Does this course count towards the M.S. in Software Systems Development?</h3>
    <p>A: Yes. In fact, this is one of the four required courses for the M.S.</p>
    <h3>Q: Did you remove information on using Kali virtual machine for this class?  If so, why?</h3>
    <p>A: Yes.  After all these years, it was more trouble than it was worth.  Further reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Accessibility. For students who are visually impaired, using a virtual machine can be very difficult.</li>
        <li>Not all students have a capable laptop. Sometimes due to financial reasons, some students use Chromebooks. The tools required for this course can be installed natively on macOS, Windows, and Linux.</li>
        <li>Performance. Sometimes, using a VM can be very slow. A VM also do not use native drivers (e.g., for networking).</li>
        <li>Hard disk space requirement: at least 10 GB necessary.</li>
        <li>Apple M1 Macs cannot run most Intel x86 virtual machines.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Q: Is Piazza used in this course?</h3>
    <p>Yes, quite a lot</p>
    <h3>Q: Why is there a course website and a course Canvas? If you say "it is a nuisance for students to use multiple websites and services for one course", what gives?</h3>
    <p>This course website serves a few critical purposes. Years ago, I made a decision to make all the readings, slide decks, and most of the labs publicly available. The reasons: (1) to show that Tufts is serious and is working on Cyber Security matters, (2) to provide learning material to the public on Cyber Security as the Cyber Security education problem is very dire, (3) for recordkeeping on what is taught and not taught in this Security class --this comes up often when we speak to industry and organizations who want to work with Tufts on Cyber Security-related matters. The Canvas site for this course isn't made publicly available. Even if Canvas site was made publicly available, content is behind a walled garden, and (4) for redundancy if Canvas goes down.</p>
    <h3>Q: I have not taken a course on Networks (CS 112), Operating Systems (CS 111), or Computer Architecture (CS 40) yet. Is that a problem?</h3>
    <p>No. Cyber Security is a very broad field and it is impossible for anyone, even professionals, to know everything. What is important for you is to start thinking about Security.</p>
    <h3>Q: If I am taking this course for professional purpose, can I have a tuition reimbursement letter or certificate?</h3>
    <p>A: <a href="https://twitter.com/0xmchow/status/1085649884663828481" target="_blank">Absolutely! It's a nice tuition reimbursement letter, hand signed!</a></p>
    <p>If you have read this far, send me an email (ming.chow AT tufts DOT edu) with the subject "What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets. But enough talk..." to earn a reward.</p>

    <h2 id="expectations">Expectations and Structure of This Course</h2>
    <p>This course will be a fun one for sure. A few notes on the expectations and structure of this course:</p>
    <h3>1. You are responsible for your own learning.</h3>
    <p>A very important point: if you want everything gone over in lecture or in notes, then this is not the course for you. More importantly, that's not how things work in real life.</p>
    <h3>2. You will learn by doing.</h3>
    <p>Each week, there will be at most three labs to hone your skills and to aim at the crux of the matter for the week. Here's an analogy: you don't learn how to cook simply by just reading cookbooks and watching YouTube videos. You learn by making, using your hands, and making mistakes.</p>
    <h3>3. You will learn by asking questions.</h3>
    <p>It is your responsibility to ask questions early and to ask for help...</p>
    <h3>4. ...and I expect discussions online to be very active and civil.</h3>
    <p>Share thoughts and respond to other people's questions. I will be online constantly.  It is no secret that I respond very quickly unless I need to be away.</p>
